**PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THIS IS STILL AN ONGOING PROJECT AND THE FIRST ONE OF IT'S KIND THAT I AM WORKING ON. IT WILL TAKE A WHILE TO FINISH BECAUSE I AM BUSY WITH UNIVERSITY.**

**WHAT I LEARNED (Still in progress):**
1. Implementing CLR GUI in Visual Studio 2019.
2. The importance of classes and libraries. 
3. Importance of comments on a huge project



Its an app i am working towards . It was meant to help new players .
