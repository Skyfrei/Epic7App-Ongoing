# Epic7App
**PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THIS IS STILL AN ONGOING PROJECT AND THE FIRST ONE OF IT'S KIND THAT I AM WORKING ON. IT WILL TAKE A WHILE TO FINISH BECAUSE I AM BUSY WITH UNIVERSITY.**

**WHAT I LEARNED (Still in progress):**
1. Implementing CLR GUI in Visual Studio 2019.
2. The importance of classes and libraries. 
3. Importance of comments on a huge project





Its an app i am working on . It was meant to help new players in the game called Epic7 (mobile game) created by Smilegate, this is entirely a free to use program and i get no profit whatsoever out of it . However theres a donate button implemented in case anyone wants to support me and the project.



(This will change if someone decides to help me with the project in the future, i will name all the users who contribute on the project below)
